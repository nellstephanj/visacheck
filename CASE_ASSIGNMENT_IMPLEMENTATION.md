# Case Assignment Orchestration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive **Case Assignment Orchestration Agent** that intelligently assigns visa application cases to case workers (human and AI agents) based on expertise, workload, capacity, and urgency.

## What Was Added

### 1. Core Service Module (`src/services/case_assignment_service.py`)

**Key Classes:**
- `AgentType` - Enum for HUMAN and AI agents
- `ExpertiseLevel` - Enum for EXPERT (3), PROFICIENT (2), BASIC (1)
- `CaseWorkerAgent` - Represents a case worker with expertise and capacity
- `CaseAssignmentOrchestrator` - Main orchestration engine

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Intelligent assignment scoring algorithm (40% expertise, 30% capacity, 20% agent type, 10% urgency)
- ✅ Workload balancing across agents
- ✅ Urgent case prioritization
- ✅ Batch assignment capabilities
- ✅ Recommendation engine
- ✅ Real-time capacity tracking

**Default Agent Pool:**
- 3 Human Agents (15, 12, 10 case capacity)
- 3 AI Agents (50, 45, 40 case capacity)
- Each with specialized expertise in case types and locations

### 2. User Interface Page (`src/pages/case_assignment.py`)

**Four Main Tabs:**

#### 📊 Dashboard Tab
- Overall workload metrics
- Agent status cards with visual capacity bars
- Color-coded utilization (green/orange/red)
- Human vs. AI agent breakdown

#### 👥 Agent Pool Tab
- Detailed agent profiles
- Expertise ratings (⭐⭐⭐)
- Filter by agent type
- Current assignment viewing

#### 📋 Assign Cases Tab
- Load pending applications (5-100 cases)
- Batch assignment with prioritization
- Assignment results with success metrics
- Unassigned cases handling

#### 🔍 Recommendations Tab
- Manual case input
- Top 3 agent recommendations
- Detailed reasoning and scoring
- Best match highlighting

### 3. Documentation

**Created:**
- `CASE_ASSIGNMENT_README.md` - Complete technical documentation (450+ lines)
- `CASE_ASSIGNMENT_QUICKSTART.md` - User-friendly quick start guide (350+ lines)
- Both include examples, workflows, troubleshooting, and best practices

### 4. Testing Suite (`src/util/test_case_assignment.py`)

**9 Comprehensive Tests:**
1. ✅ Agent Creation
2. ✅ Expertise Scoring
3. ✅ Workload Tracking
4. ✅ Assignment Scoring
5. ✅ Single Case Assignment
6. ✅ Batch Assignment
7. ✅ Recommendations
8. ✅ Workload Summary
9. ✅ Urgent Prioritization

**All tests passing (100% success rate)**

### 5. Navigation Integration

Updated `src/main.py` to include the new Case Assignment page in the authenticated user navigation flow:
- Added between Active Applications and Sexy Visa Agent
- Icon: 🎯
- Title: "Case Assignment"

## Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Agent Matching

The system considers multiple factors:

```python
Assignment Score = (
    Expertise Match    × 40% +    # Case type + Location
    Capacity Available × 30% +    # Workload vs. Max
    Agent Type Fit     × 20% +    # Human vs AI
    Urgency Factor     × 10%      # Priority handling
)
```

### Example Scoring

**Case:** Urgent Schengen visa from Sydney FO

**Top Match:** Sarah Mitchell (96.0% score)
- ⭐⭐⭐ Expert in Schengen visas
- ⭐⭐⭐ Expert in Sydney FO
- 0% capacity (0/15 cases)
- Human agent ideal for urgent cases

### Workload Balancing

Prevents agent overload:
- Respects capacity limits
- Distributes evenly when expertise is similar
- Tracks real-time utilization
- Visual indicators for capacity status

### Human vs. AI Agents

**Human Agents:**
- Lower capacity (10-15 cases)
- Better for complex/urgent cases
- Verification role for AI work
- Manual decision authority

**AI Agents:**
- Higher capacity (40-50 cases)
- Fast processing for routine cases
- 24/7 availability
- Requires human verification

## Integration with Existing System

### Workflow Integration

```
📋 Visa Intake
    ↓ (new applications)
📊 Active Applications
    ↓ (pending cases)
🎯 Case Assignment  ← NEW!
    ↓ (assigned to agents)
🤖 Sexy Visa Agent
    ↓ (processing workflow)
✅ Completion
```

### Data Flow

1. **Load Cases**: Import from Active Applications (via people directory)
2. **Assign**: Use orchestration algorithm to assign to best agents
3. **Track**: Monitor agent workload and capacity
4. **Process**: Cases flow to Sexy Visa Agent workflow
5. **Verify**: Human agents verify AI agent work

## Technical Architecture

```

### Singleton Pattern
- Global orchestrator instance via `get_orchestrator()`
- Persistent agent pool across sessions
- Shared state management

## Usage Examples

### Batch Assignment (Python)
```python
from services.case_assignment_service import get_orchestrator

orchestrator = get_orchestrator()
assignments = orchestrator.assign_cases_batch(
    cases=[case1, case2, case3],
    prioritize_urgent=True
)
```

### Get Recommendations (Python)
```python
recommendations = orchestrator.recommend_assignment(case)
# Returns top 3 agents with scores and reasoning
```

### UI Workflow (User)
1. Login to VisaCheck
2. Navigate to 🎯 Case Assignment
3. Go to 📋 Assign Cases tab
4. Load 25 pending cases
5. Enable urgent prioritization
6. Click "Assign All Cases"
7. Review results

# Application Decision Agent - Documentation

## Overview

The Application Decision Agent is an AI-powered advisory system that provides visa application decision recommendations to human officers. It analyzes multiple criteria including financial sufficiency, travel documentation, background checks, and document consistency to generate a comprehensive recommendation with transparent reasoning.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The Decision Agent provides **advisory recommendations only**. All final legal decisions must be made by qualified human officers. The agent's role is to support, not replace, human judgment.

## Purpose

The Decision Agent serves to:
- Provide consistent, objective preliminary assessments
- Highlight critical issues requiring human attention
- Standardize evaluation criteria across cases
- Accelerate case processing while maintaining quality
- Ensure transparent, traceable decision rationale

## Features

Evaluates:
- Name consistency across all documents (-5 pts penalty)
- Date consistency verification (-5 pts penalty)
- Passport MRZ validation (-7 pts penalty)
- Document integrity analysis (-3 pts if <90%)

### 2. Decision Thresholds

The system uses the following decision logic:

```
if blocking_issues_present:
    ‚Üí MANUAL_REVIEW
elif total_score >= 85:
    ‚Üí APPROVE
elif 60 <= total_score < 85:
    ‚Üí MANUAL_REVIEW
elif total_score < 60:
    ‚Üí REJECT
```

**Blocking Issues** (trigger immediate MANUAL_REVIEW):
- Active Schengen entry ban
- MRZ validation failure
- Critical security flags
